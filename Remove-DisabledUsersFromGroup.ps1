function Remove-DisabledUsersFromGroup {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    This script will remove disabled AD users from an AD group that they are still members of.
    .DESCRIPTION
    The Remove-ADGroupMember cmdlet removes AD group members from an AD group. This function lets you remove all disabled users from a
    targeted AD group and it sends a log file to your specified path. *Note - typically this cmdlet prompts for confirmation on each
    removal, but that is being bypassed with the "-Confirm:$false" command on line 27
