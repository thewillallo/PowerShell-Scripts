function Set-RandomUserUIDAndGID {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    This script will set the uidnumber and gidnumber LDAP attributes to a unique value for users in Active Directory.
    .DESCRIPTION
    The Set-ADUser cmdlet is used to set LDAP attributes on an Active Directory user. This function will run and add the gidnumber and
    uidnumber attributes where they are empty. These attributes are used for Unix systems. The formula to generating this value ensures
    a unique value for each user.
